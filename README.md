# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

I have learnt how to use an open-source CSS framework called Bootstrap so that I can make websites faster and easier. I have used what I have learnt to build a webpage which  will act as my Portfolio. I created this so that when I apply to jobs in the future, I can use this portfolio to showcase myself and all the projects that I have completed. This portfolio also shows others that I am able to use and implement an open-source framework into my coding which is useful as it a job may require me to use something similar.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use the website, you would use this link: https://zubeidadhupli.github.io/repository .The link should take you to where the webpage is live on GitHub Pages. When you make the screen smaller, the screen should be responsive as Bootstrap is mobile-first. This was done so that the website would be easier to navigate on smaller devices. I have also added box shadows to the contact icons so that when you hover on them, the icons stand out more. Here is a screenshot that shows the box shadow in action: ![image of icons with shadow when hovering](./images/hover-box-shadow.png) .
